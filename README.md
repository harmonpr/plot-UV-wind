# Plotting U and V wind velocity component

![Image wind velocity components](https://github.com/harmonpr/plot-UV-wind/blob/master/map.png)

This repo is a tutorial how to plot wind component. You can see the step by step in the Jupyter Notebook <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/harmonpr/plot-UV-wind/blob/master/plot_UV_components.ipynb" target="_blank">here</a>. Also, there is a python file that can directly run.

The data can be downloaded <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O2sFzvaP43j2DQpviqai1d2_vBPoFsFB/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>. The data is spatial and temporal limited, only specific time and location not global data. However, more data can be downloaded officially <a href="https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=form" target="_blank">here</a>.

Make sure ```numpy```, ```pandas```, ```matplotlib```, ```xarray```, and ```cartopy``` libraries are installed.
